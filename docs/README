This folder contains templates to create a two-page Ecosysten and Socioeconomic Profile report card.

`report card pg 1.qmd` can be edited to produce the first page of the report card. `tex_template.tex` is a necessary helper file, which can be updated if desired. 

`table_template.Rmd` can be run to create the summary table of indicator data. `table_template.xlsx` should  be updated with relevant indicator information, including file paths to figures. `table_template.Rmd` should not be updated.
