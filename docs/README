This folder contains files to create a two-page Ecosysten and Socioeconomic Profile report card for the 2026 Longfin Squid Research Track Stock Assessment.

`test_longfin_report_card.qmd` can be edited to produce the first page of the report card. `tex_template.tex` is a necessary helper file, which can be updated if desired. Rendering `test_longfin_report_card.qmd` will produce a PDF (test_longfin_report_card.pdf).

`table_template.Rmd` can be run to create the summary table of indicator data. `table_template.xlsx` should  be updated with relevant indicator information, including file paths to figures. `table_template.Rmd` should not be updated.
Plotting code to run and save images for each indicator (bottomT, GSI, commercial) can be found in the 'scripts' folder. The function `plt_indicator` in `plot_indicator_ts.R` is used to plot all indicator time series.

Backgrounds for page 1 and 2 of the report card must be added in Adobe Acrobat, as bugs in the code prevent the backgrounds from loading directly into the PDF from the qmd file. 
To add backgrounds:
 1. Separate pages by Edit -> Organize pages -> Right click on page 2 -> Extract pages (This should open up a new tab with just page 2)
 2. Click the trash can icon to remove page 2
 3. Add page 1 background: In the same 'Edit' tab, select 'More' -> Background -> Add. A pop-up box will appear.
        - Select 'File' and 'Browse' for `bg_pg1.jpg` in the 'docs' folder
 4. Repeat step 3 for page 2, attaching `bg_pg2.jpg` as the background
 5. Combine pages 1 and 2 with backgrounds: Edit -> Organize pages -> Insert -> From File -> (Insert file of page 2 with background)
